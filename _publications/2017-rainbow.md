permalink: /publication/2017-rainbow
excerpt: 'We modify the standard relativistic dispersion relation in a way which breaks Lorentz symmetry—the effect is predicted in a high-energy regime of some modern theories of quantum gravity. We show that it is possible to realise this scenario within the framework of Rainbow Gravity which introduces two new energy-dependent functions f1(E) and f2(E) into the dispersion relation. Additionally, we assume that the gravitational constant G and the cosmological constant Λ also
depend on energy E and introduce the scaling function h(E) in order to express this dependence. For cosmological applications we specify the functions f1 and f2 in order to fit massless particles which allows us to derive modified cosmological equations. Finally, by using Hubble+SNIa+BAO(BOSS+Lyman α )+CMB data, we constrain the energy scale E_{LV} to be at least of the order of 10^16 GeV at 1σ which is the GUT scale or even higher 10^17 GeV at 3σ . Our claim is that this energy can be
interpreted as the decoupling scale of massless particles from spacetime Lorentz violating effects.'
