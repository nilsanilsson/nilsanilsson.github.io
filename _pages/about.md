I am a Senior Researcher at the IBS Center for Theoretical Physics of the Universe (Cosmology and Gravity group) in Daejeon, Korea.
My main research interests include the **theory and phenomenology of spacetime-symmetry breaking in gravity and cosmology**, which I explore using effective-field theory techniques. I am also interested in early-Universe physics, cosmic tensions, and the mathematics of group theory. One of my current long-term projects focuses on Post-Newtonian theory and the generation of gravitational waves by compact sources in the presence of spacetime-symmetry breaking.
