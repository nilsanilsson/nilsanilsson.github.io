Postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Quantum Spacetime in Seoul, Korea. My main research interests
include gravity theory and possible consequences of Lorentz violation, in particular bridging theory and
observations. I am also interested in early-Universe physics and General Relativity.

In my free time, I enjoy board games, running, and rock climbing.
