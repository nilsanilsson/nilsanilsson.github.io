I am a CNES postdoctoral fellow working at Observatoire de Paris in France.
My main research interests include theory and phenomenology of spacetime-symmetry breaking in gravity and cosmology, which I explore using effective-field theory techniques. I am also interested in early-Universe physics, cosmic tensions, and the mathematics of group theory. At Observatoire de Paris I focus on Post-Newtonian theory and the generation of gravitational waves by compact sources in the presence of spacetime-symmetry breaking.
