CNES postdoctoral fellow working at Observatoire de Paris in Paris, France. My main research interests
include gravity theory and possible consequences of Lorentz violation, in particular bridging theory and
observations. I am also interested in early-Universe physics and General Relativity.

In my free time, I enjoy board games, running, and rock climbing.
