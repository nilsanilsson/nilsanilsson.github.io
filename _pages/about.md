Highly analytical early-career researcher in physics with teaching experience. My main research interests
are phenomenology of new physics in gravity and cosmology, in particular bridging theory and
observations. I am also interested in early-Universe physics and General Relativity.

In my free time, I enjoy board games, beer, and rock climbing.
